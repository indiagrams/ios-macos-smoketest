// READING TEXT OUT OF AN ELEMENT, ON BOTH PLATFORMS. NOTHING IN THIS FILE NAMES AN APPLICATION.
//
// This file and its companion `BlindReadGuards.swift` are compiled into BOTH UI-test targets and
// contain no identifier, no view name, no string and no type belonging to the application under
// test. Drop the directory into any SwiftUI project, list it in the two UI-test targets, and it
// works — that property is deliberate and is asserted by a grep, not by intention.
//
// THE MEASUREMENT THIS FILE EXISTS FOR, macOS 26.5.2 (Build 25F84), an out-of-process
// accessibility client reading the same API XCUITest reads, six shapes with two negative controls
// (`evidence/07-UITESTSUPPORT-ax-shapes.swift`, 2026-09-10):
//
//     shape                                   AXRole         AXValue    AXDescription  `.label`
//     a plain `Text`                          AXStaticText   content    nil            ""
//     a `Text` in a `List` row                AXStaticText   content    nil            ""
//     `Label(_:systemImage:)` in a `List`     AXStaticText   content    nil            ""
//     a `Text` + `.accessibilityAddTraits`    AXHeading      nil        content        reads
//       `(.isHeader)`
//     a container + `.accessibilityLabel`     AXGroup        nil        content        reads
//     a `NavigationLink`'s label              AXUnknown      nil        content        reads
//
// A SEVENTH SHAPE WAS ADDED ON 2026-09-11, AND IT IS WHY THIS FILE READS A THIRD ATTRIBUTE.
// Every row above is an IN-WINDOW shape. A MENU ITEM is not, and it publishes its text in a
// third place again:
//
//     shape                                   elementType    `.value`   `.label`       `.title`
//     an item in a macOS menu                 menuItem (54)  ""         ""             content
//
// Measured on a running macOS app, twice and independently: a menu row read back
// `type=54 label="" value="" title="<the item's text>"`, and a second suite reached a menu item
// whose text it already knew and got it out of `title` alone. So on that shape the two-attribute
// rule is STRUCTURALLY BLIND — it can only ever answer "", for an item rendering the right text
// and one rendering the wrong text alike. That is the exact condition the guards in
// `BlindReadGuards.swift` exist to name, and they did name it, on this shape's first execution.
//
// macOS publishes a plain SwiftUI `Text`'s content in **AXValue alone**. XCUITest's `.label` is
// built from AXDescription and never reads AXValue. It does NOT fall back to AXTitle either:
// measured on a CI macOS runner (run 34984109925, 2026-09-15), every item of the app's own menu
// read `label=""` while `title` carried its text (`title="About …"`). That is the seventh shape
// above, and it is why `title` is asked for separately below. So on macOS
// `element.label` is a CONSTANT EMPTY STRING for the three commonest text shapes a SwiftUI author
// writes — for an element rendering the wrong string and for one rendering the right string alike.
// On iOS the same `Text` publishes its content AS its label, which is why a suite can be green on
// one platform for years while the other has never measured its subject.
//
// THE READ RULE IS `label` FIRST, THEN THE STRING `value`, THEN `title`, AND THE ORDER IS
// LOAD-BEARING. Asking `label` first keeps iOS byte-identical, keeps every element that already
// answers answering the same thing, and reads through rather than going stale if a future macOS
// starts publishing an AXDescription for these shapes. Each fallback is asked ONLY when every
// answer before it is empty, so this rule can never CHANGE a read — it can only turn a
// non-answer into an answer. That property is asserted by the probe cited above (its check 4),
// it is what made adopting this file at an existing call site not a behaviour change on iOS, and
// it is equally what makes adding the third attribute not a behaviour change at any existing
// call site: every read that answered before answers the same thing today.
//
// THREE NAMED ATTRIBUTES, AND DELIBERATELY NOT "WHATEVER IS NON-EMPTY". The rule is a list of
// attributes each of which was MEASURED to carry a rendered string for a named shape, not a
// search. Widening it to "try everything" would make `readable` mean "something, somewhere, was
// non-empty" — and then an element whose text is genuinely unpublished would read as some
// unrelated attribute's content and the blind-read guards would stop being able to fire. A
// fourth attribute belongs here only with an eighth shape measured beside it.
//
// WHAT IS STILL REFUSED. An element that publishes its text in NONE of these three reads "" and
// trips `assertReadable`. That is the whole point of the guards and it is unchanged.
//
// THIS IS A RULE ABOUT READING, NOT ABOUT FINDING. Element MATCHING is a separate mechanism with
// separate inputs and it is NOT blind: on the same macOS run where `.label` read empty on three
// elements, the `matching(identifier:)` COUNT of those same three elements passed. Do not rewrite
// a working query on the strength of this file. `docs/UI-TESTING-ON-BOTH-PLATFORMS.md` states the
// distinction at length, including what about matching is measured and what is still open.
//
// SWIFT 5.9 / `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY: minimal`, matching both UI-test targets. No concurrency
// of any kind is used here and no Swift 6 isolation syntax appears.
