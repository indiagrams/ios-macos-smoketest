# Unit test for tools/migrate-identity.rb — three-state detection, the exit-code
# contract, and the argv parser (IDENT-14, D-70).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# A migration that reports success without having looked at the tree is this
# project's signature failure mode, observed rather than imagined. Upstream's
# post-#281 `check_idempotency` keys on ONE signal (app/Identity.xcconfig
# exists), which is true post-#281 and false pre-#281 — so on exactly the tree
# this migration exists to serve it answers "not migrated" for the right reason
# and "migrated" for the wrong one. And bin/rename.sh's own three-state detector
# returns a bare 0/1/2 with no message at all, so a partial tree is reported by a
# number. D-70 rejected a silent idempotent exit 0 BY NAME: it is
# indistinguishable from a migration that did nothing because it could not see
# the fork's state.
#
# So every assertion below checks the exit code AND the message together. A
# command that exits 3 on a partially-migrated tree while naming nothing has
# satisfied the number and defeated the point; `assert_exit` fails it.
#
# THE STATES, AND WHY EACH SIGNAL IS SPELLED OUT HERE
#
#   never-migrated       none of the four signals present  -> exit 0 (--dry-run)
#   already fully mig.   all four present                  -> exit 0, LOUD
#   partially migrated   any mixture                       -> exit 3, naming each
#
# Every constant below is duplicated deliberately rather than derived from the
# file under test — the rule test/identity_test.rb:56-60 states: a test that
# reads its expectations out of its subject accepts whatever that subject
# happens to say, which is not a test. The four signal labels, the five exit
# codes and the three state names are written out here by hand, and a rewording
# on either side is meant to break this file.
#
# FAILURE-LINE CONTRACT
#
# This file adopts test/identity_test.rb's one-line contract —
#
#     FAIL <group> <path>: <message>
#
# — and NOT the `✗` shape from test/parser_test.rb. The choice is stated once,
# here, and kept: the red controls that drive this suite against a deliberately
# broken command grep for `^FAIL`, and a two-line failure would make every one of
# them vacuous. Detail lines (expected/actual) follow the FAIL line, indented,
# and never begin with FAIL.
#
# HOW IT INVOKES THE COMMAND
#
# Through the interpreter running THIS file (RbConfig.ruby), never through the
# command's `#!/usr/bin/env ruby` shebang. Running the suite under 4.0.6 while
# the subprocess silently resolved PATH's ruby — which on a bare shell here is
# /usr/bin/ruby 2.6.10 — would make "green under both pinned interpreters" a
# claim about one interpreter. Executability is asserted separately, by mode.
#
# Runnable locally, from the repository root, under BOTH pinned interpreters —
# and it must pass under both, spelled out because on this machine ambient
# `ruby` IS 3.3 and the second path is the one that gets skipped:
#   /opt/homebrew/opt/ruby@3.3/bin/ruby test/migrate_identity_test.rb
#   /opt/homebrew/opt/ruby@4.0/bin/ruby test/migrate_identity_test.rb
# Never /usr/bin/ruby (2.6.10).
#
# CI caller: .github/workflows/migrate.yml, added by plan 05-05. Until then this
# suite has no CI caller and is run by hand — stated out loud rather than left
# to be discovered, because a suite nobody runs is not a gate.
#
# Ruby core only, three `require`s, no gem — which is what lets a caller in the
# `review notes` job keep `bundler-cache: false`. Every shell-out is an explicit
# argv array, never a shell string. No broad rescue: the only rescue in this file
# names Errno::ENOENT, and it exists to tell "the command is not there" apart
# from "the command failed".
#
# THE MUTATION HALF (group M7, plan 05-03)
#
# M7 runs the command against a REAL git repository built in a temp dir, because
# the clean-tree gate, the on-main gate, the Team-ID ignore gate and the rollback
# are all git operations and a synthetic directory cannot exercise any of them.
#
# Two fixture knobs of the command's own contract are driven here, and both
# announce themselves on stderr — asserted, because a silent knob is a way to
# disable a gate without anything going red:
#
#   MIGRATE_IDENTITY_TOOL_DIR    resolves xcodebuild and xcodegen from a fixture
#                                bin directory instead of PATH. Without it these
#                                cases would say something different on a machine
#                                with Xcode than on one without, which is not a
#                                test. git is deliberately NOT resolved through it.
#   MIGRATE_IDENTITY_FAIL_AFTER  raises after a named mutation stage, which is the
#                                only way to reach the rollback path from a test
#                                without breaking the command on purpose.
#
# THE STRUCTURAL HALF (group M8, plan 05-04)
#
# M8 asserts the other half of the transformation: the five history-preserving
# renames, the two declaration rewrites, both manifests rewired onto $(VAR), the
# .gitignore project paths, the stale generated project's proven absence, and the
# identity gate's GREEN half — the pair whose red half ci/test-migrate-identity.sh
# already records as `RESULT baseline=preflight-unmigrated-fixture exit=2`.
#
# Two of its assertions are shaped by defects this project has already shipped
# rather than by a style preference:
#
#   * MUST-NOT-TOUCH is asserted by SHA-256 DIGEST, not by a grep for the fork
#     token. In a pre-#281 fork structure and identity are the same token, so a
#     reverse sweep that rewrites every occurrence eats the forker's own
#     choices — the accessibility selector "<N>.title" is a UI-test contract and
#     the Localizable.xcstrings key is user-visible. A grep for the token would
#     go green on a file that had been rewritten some other way; a digest will
#     not, and the failure names both digests.
#
#   * HISTORY is asserted from `git diff --cached -M --name-status`. A
#     copy-and-delete produces exactly the same end state as a `git mv` and
#     leaves the migration unreviewable, and only the R-versus-A/D status
#     distinguishes them.
#
# The fixture xcodebuild emits a -showBuildSettings dump shaped like the real one
# (four-space indent, "KEY = value", one "Build settings for action" header),
# carrying the values a PRE-#281 renamed fork actually resolves: PRODUCT_NAME is
# the TARGET name including its platform suffix, because nothing sets it (A-05);
# CFBundleDisplayName is not a build setting at all and has to be read out of the
# generated plist; and NSHumanReadableCopyright is an INFOPLIST_KEY_ on iOS but a
# plist property on macOS. All three shapes were read off e773cfc:app/project.yml
# rather than assumed.
