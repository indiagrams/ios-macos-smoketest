# Regression test for bin/setup-github.sh — the read-append-assert branch-protection
# write (D-63, ledger row UL-003).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS SHAPED THE WAY IT IS.
#
# The defect this pins is the one whose failure mode is silent. `bin/setup-github.sh`
# used to recompute the required-status-checks array from the platform matrix and PUT
# the whole `/protection` object. Nothing went red when it ran: the `review notes` job
# kept running and kept reporting, protection simply listed eight contexts where nine
# were expected, and a pull request with a red drift check became mergeable again. The
# check that stops gating looks exactly like the check that is gating — see
# docs/CONTRIBUTING-UPSTREAM.md section 6.
#
# A test for a silent failure has to be positive. "Nothing blew up" is what the bug
# looks like, so every case below asserts on a value: the exact POST body computed for
# a before-list that is short by one, the exact exit code and stderr when the post-write
# read comes back short, and the preserved presence of a context the script has never
# heard of.
#
# THE SCRIPT UNDER TEST IS NEVER RUN UNTIL IT IS SAFE TO RUN IT. The pre-fix script's
# only protection code path is a destructive live PUT, so executing it "to see what it
# does" would perform the very write this plan exists to prevent. The static guard below
# therefore runs FIRST and reads the source as text: it fails when a
# `gh api -X PUT "repos/$REPO/branches/main/protection"` occurs outside a branch gated on
# a 404 probe, and it fails when the script advertises no SETUP_GITHUB_DRY_RUN. While
# either static assertion fails, the behavioural cases are SKIPPED with a FAIL line
# saying why. Red for this suite means "did not even run the script", deliberately.
#
# THE gh SHIM IS THE THIRD ASSERTION. Every behavioural case puts a scratch `gh` first on
# PATH that appends its argv to a log and exits 1. After each case the log must be empty.
# A stub that replaced a read but left a write live would show up here as a logged argv
# rather than as a passing test, and a `gh` that leaked through from the real PATH would
# fail the case outright.
#
# Runnable locally, no gem, no framework, matching test/parser_test.rb:
#   ruby test/setup_github_test.rb
