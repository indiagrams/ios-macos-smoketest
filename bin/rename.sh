# bin/rename.sh — fork PERSONALIZATION script for the apple-shipkit template.
#
# Substitutes two things and nothing else: the maintainer contact address and
# the GitHub owner/repo slug. Atomic (all-or-nothing via reset-hard rollback),
# idempotent (silent no-op on re-run), pre-flight-gated.
#
# The app's IDENTITY is no longer this script's business. Bundle id, product
# name, display name and copyright live in app/Identity.xcconfig — the one
# tracked identity file, read natively by both generators as $(VAR) and by
# bin/lib/xcconfig.rb, the one reader. Set them there. A fork created before
# that file existed migrates with tools/migrate-identity.rb; see
# docs/MIGRATING-FROM-RENAME.md.
#
# The project STRUCTURE is a constant and is never renamed: app/App.xcodeproj,
# the App-iOS / App-macOS schemes, app/Shared/App.swift, App.entitlements and
# the App*Tests targets stay as they are on every fork.
#
# Usage:
#   bin/rename.sh --email=EMAIL [--slug=OWNER/REPO] [--dry-run] [--force]
#   bin/rename.sh -h                                # print this usage
#   bin/rename.sh --help                            # alias for -h
#
# Required flag:
#   --email=EMAIL  Maintainer/security contact email; substitutes
#                  maintainers@indiagram.com across CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
#                  and SECURITY.md. MUST NOT contain newline or '|'.
#
# Optional flags:
#   --slug=OWNER/REPO   GitHub org/repo slug; substitutes
#                       indiagrams/apple-shipkit in README.md and
#                       CONTRIBUTING.md, and ONLY there — see "Slug scope"
#                       below. If omitted, auto-derives from
#                       `git remote get-url origin`. MUST NOT contain
#                       newline or '|'.
#   --dry-run           Preview substitutions without applying.
#   --force             Override the on-main-branch gate AND the partial-
#                       personalization gate. The other gates (args
#                       validation, clean tree, sed escapes) still fire.
#
# Slug scope — why the substitution set is an allowlist and not a sweep:
#   In a fork, nearly every occurrence of the template slug names the TEMPLATE:
#   the upstream you add as a remote, clone beside your fork, and send fixes to.
#   Only README.md's badge URLs and CONTRIBUTING.md's issue link mean "this
#   repository". A tree-wide sweep therefore rewrites the pointers that tell a
#   forker where to file things upstream — and it already has: AGENTS.md's
#   "open an upstream issue at ..." row in this fork names the FORK's own slug,
#   and no gate saw it happen.
#   So the sites that ARE substituted are named explicitly and everything else
#   is left alone, rather than the other way round. A list of exceptions rots
#   the moment somebody adds a file; an allowlist does not. Two sites that must
#   keep naming the template are additionally snapshotted before the step and
#   asserted unchanged after it, so a future widening of the scope fails loudly
#   instead of quietly eating a pointer.
#
# Retired in Phase 5, and refused BY NAME rather than silently ignored, so a
# forker who pastes an old command line is told what happened instead of
# getting "unknown flag": the three positional args (app name, bundle id,
# display name), --year, --generator, --platforms and --team-id. What replaced
# each one is in the refusal message and in docs/MIGRATING-FROM-RENAME.md.
#
# Argument forms:
#   --email=VAL    (preferred, equal-sign form)
#   --email VAL    (split form — VAL must be non-empty and not start with '-')
#
# Pre-flight gate ORDER (canonical):
#   1. Args parsing (split-flag values rejected if missing or '-'-prefixed;
#      retired flags and positional args refused by name)
#   2. Idempotency check, BEFORE the clean-tree gate —
#      case 0 = silent exit 0 (already personalized)
#      case 1 = partial-personalization fail (unless --force)
#      case 2 = proceed
#   3. EMAIL non-empty AND no newline/'|'
#   4. SLUG non-empty (auto-derived if absent) AND no newline/'|' AND OWNER/REPO
#   5. Working tree is clean (git status --short empty — strict, includes
#      untracked files; this prevents data-loss via reset-hard)
#   6. Current branch is `main` (override via --force)
#
# Idempotency:
#   The signal is the two literals this script substitutes AWAY, counted only in
#   the sites this script actually writes. Neither remaining = done, exit 0
#   silently. Both remaining = proceed. Exactly one remaining = a half-done tree,
#   refused unless --force. Keyed on what the script writes, deliberately: the
#   previous version keyed idempotency on app/Identity.xcconfig's bundle id and
#   product name, which this script no longer touches at all, so it could only
#   ever have reported on somebody else's work.
#
# All-or-nothing (reset-hard rollback — never git stash):
#   Gate 5 (clean tree) ensures HEAD == working tree pre-mutation. Any failure
#   in the sed steps triggers the ERR/EXIT/INT/TERM trap, which executes:
#     1. git reset --hard HEAD --quiet   (restores tracked-file modifications)
#     2. git clean -fd --quiet           (removes new untracked files; NOT -fdx,
#        which would delete the forker's .bootstrap.env and app/Local.xcconfig)
#   Exits 1 with stderr "rolled back to pre-personalization state."
#   A MUTATION_STARTED guard keeps the trap from firing those destructive ops on
#   a pre-mutation gate failure, where they would destroy uncommitted work.
#
# Constraints:
#   - bash 3.2+ (macOS default); no bash 4+ features
#   - BSD-portable sed (sed -i '', | delimiter, escaped dots)
#   - sed replacement values escaped via sed_escape_replacement
#   - No new external dependencies (git, bash, sed, grep, awk)

# ── Reset-hard rollback ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Background: an early iteration used `git stash push --include-untracked` to
# capture pre-state. On a clean working tree — which the clean-tree gate
# requires — `git stash` creates NO entry, so rollback was a silent no-op and
# mutations were never undone.
#
# Fix: leverage the clean-tree precondition. Pre-mutation HEAD == working tree,
# so `git reset --hard HEAD` restores tracked-file modifications. Plus
# `git clean -fd` for any new untracked files — NEVER -fdx, which would delete
# the forker's .bootstrap.env and app/Local.xcconfig.
#
# The MUTATION_STARTED guard prevents the trap from firing destructive ops on a
# PRE-mutation gate failure (e.g. the dirty-tree gate fails → trap →
# reset --hard → destroys the forker's uncommitted work). It is initialized to 0
# here at file scope and flipped to 1 inside main() immediately before the first
# mutation call. rollback() early-outs unless the flag is set.

# ── Substitution-target enumeration ──────────────────────────────────────
#
# Why -nw -e P (not -nE '(\b|^)P\b'):
# the regex form silently false-passes in git grep — it returns 0 hits when 14
# are present. -nw is git-grep-native and reliable.
#
# Why -F on both patterns:
# without -F, the literal `.` in an address and the `/` in a slug are regex
# metacharacters, so `git grep -nw -e maintainers@indiagram.com` would match
# `maintainers@indiagramXcom`. -F treats the pattern as a fixed string, and
# -F + -w combine correctly in git grep.
#
# Why the exclusions below (each one MEASURED with a --dry-run against this
# tree, not inherited):
# this file and test/rename_scope_test.rb each SPELL the contact address — in this
# file's usage block, sed patterns and step announcements, and in the test as the
# literal it checks for. Without the exclusions the email sweep would rewrite the
# running script and its own checker. test/rename_scope_test.rb is the sharper of
# the two: it asserts that THIS step still exists, by spelling the address as a
# frozen constant, so a sweep that rewrote it would leave every fork with a test
# looking for the fork's own address inside a script that still says the
# template's — a gate this script broke on its way past. Found by running
# --dry-run rather than by reasoning about it.
#
# The list also carried two exclusions for the rename self-check script and its
# end-to-end harness, until Phase 5 deleted both files.
# A pathspec naming a path that does not exist is not harmless decoration: it is
# an exclusion nobody can evaluate, and the next reader has to go looking for a
# file to find out it is gone. Removed with them.
# app/App.xcodeproj is generated and gitignored, and .planning is gitignored;
# both are listed so the intent survives if either ever becomes tracked.
#
# The pre-Phase-5 list also excluded bin/lib/bootstrap.rb and
# .github/workflows/bootstrap-doctor-matrix.yml. Both exclusions existed for the
# retired app-name sweep and for the tree-wide slug sweep respectively; measured
# on this tree, neither file contains the contact address, and the slug step no
# longer sweeps anything it is not explicitly pointed at, so both were dropped
# rather than carried as decoration. The workflow's
# `github.repository == 'indiagrams/apple-shipkit'` safety guard is protected by
# the slug allowlist below, which never visits that file.

# GSD-SLUG-EXCLUSION. These sites must keep naming the TEMPLATE. They are not
