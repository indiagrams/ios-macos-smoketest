// ASSERT THAT THE INSTRUMENT CAN SEE, BEFORE ASSERTING WHAT IT SEES. APP-AGNOSTIC BY CONSTRUCTION.
//
// A UI-test read that comes back empty is not a failure signal. It is the ABSENCE of a signal, and
// an assertion placed on top of it reports something — usually something confident and wrong. Two
// shapes of that were shipped in this repository and both are named in the doc comments below,
// because a guard whose motivation is abstract gets deleted by the next person who finds it noisy:
//
//   1  LOUD AND MISLEADING. `XCTAssertEqual(Set(readings).count, expectedCount)` reported
//      "two elements render the same value" when the truth was three EMPTY reads —
//      `Set(["", "", ""]).count` is 1 as surely as `Set(["a", "a", "b"]).count` is 2. A duplicate
//      is a defect in the application; an empty sweep is a blind instrument. Opposite findings,
//      and the second was reported in the first's words. That cost a session.
//
//   2  SILENT AND GREEN. `XCTAssertEqual(derived.label, transform(source.label))` compared
//      `"" == ""` and recorded a pass, for two phases, because the transform in use mapped the
//      empty string to the empty string. A gate that has stopped measuring its subject and says so
//      to nobody is worse than one that fails: a loud failure announces itself on the next run.
//
// THE RULE THESE ENCODE: assert READABILITY first, as its own assertion with its own message, then
// assert the RELATION. Two assertions where there was one. Nothing is weakened — every original
// assertion survives verbatim as the second half — and the two opposite findings can no longer
// wear each other's words.
//
// WHY THESE ARE FREE FUNCTIONS: a UI-test suite's helpers are not all `XCTestCase` methods, and
// these must be callable from a driver type, from an extension, and from a test body alike. Each
// takes `file`/`line` defaulted to the CALL SITE, so a failure points at the assertion a reader is
// looking for rather than at this file.
//
// NOTHING HERE NAMES AN APPLICATION. No identifier, no view, no string, no type belonging to the
// application under test appears in this file — the same property `ElementText.swift` holds, and
// for the same reason: this is meant to be dropped into any SwiftUI project unchanged.
//
// SWIFT 5.9 / `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY: minimal`, matching both UI-test targets.

/// Read `element` and FAIL, naming a BLIND READ, if the read is empty — then return the text.
///
/// Use this everywhere a read feeds another assertion. The returned value is safe to compare
/// against, because the comparison is only reached once the read has been shown to have happened:
///
///     let source = assertReadable(sourceElement, "the source value")
///     XCTAssertEqual(assertReadable(derivedElement, "the derived value"), transform(source))
///
/// `what` is prose naming the element in the reader's own vocabulary — "the first row's title",
/// "the detail pane's timestamp". It is the whole value of the message, so spell it for somebody
/// reading a CI log three weeks from now with no access to the screen.
///
/// AN EMPTY READ IS NOT NECESSARILY AN ABSENT ELEMENT. On macOS the three commonest SwiftUI text
/// shapes publish their content in `AXValue` alone and XCUITest's `.label` never reads it, so an
/// element that is present, correct and on screen still reads empty through `label`.
/// ``XCUIElement/renderedText`` is what this function reads, so that case is already handled; a
/// failure here means the text is in neither attribute, which is a genuine finding.
