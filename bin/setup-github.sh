#!/usr/bin/env bash
# bin/setup-github.sh — apply standard GitHub configuration (branch protection, squash, auto-merge) to a
# repo derived from this template.
#
# What it sets:
#   - Default branch: main
#   - Branch protection on main:
#       * Require PR before merging (no direct pushes)
#       * Require status checks (swiftlint + swiftformat + per-generator
#         app cells — xcodegen if app/project.yml is committed, tuist if
#         app/Project.swift is committed; both manifests = both check sets)
#       * Require status checks to be up-to-date before merge
#       * Enforce on admins (no bypass — same rules apply to repo owner)
#       * Require linear history
#   - Disable merge commits + rebase merges (squash-only)
#   - Auto-delete head branches after merge
#
# Usage:
#   bin/setup-github.sh                              # uses current repo's origin
#   bin/setup-github.sh owner/repo                   # explicit target
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - gh CLI authenticated with admin:repo scope (`gh auth status` shows it)
#   - You are the repo admin (or an org admin)
#
# Idempotent — safe to re-run; existing settings are overwritten with these.

#
# WHAT CHANGED AND WHY. This script used to recompute the required-status-checks
# array from its own idea of the platform matrix and PUT the whole `/protection`
# object. That is destructive twice over. It drops any required check this script
# did not author — a fork that adds one gets it silently removed on the next run,
# and nothing goes red, because the dropped job keeps running and keeps
# reporting; protection just lists one fewer context and a pull request with a
# red check becomes mergeable again. And a PUT rebuilds the entire protection
# object from whatever the caller supplies, so a caller who omits enforce_admins,
# required_linear_history or the approving-review count weakens the branch while
# appearing to add a check. NEVER PUT /protection on a repo that already has
# protection — see docs/CONTRIBUTING-UPSTREAM.md section 6.
#
# What it does instead, when protection already exists:
#   1. GET  …/branches/main/protection/required_status_checks/contexts  -> before
#   2. want    = unique(before + this script's checks + the extra-checks list)
#   3. missing = want - before
#   4. POST …/required_status_checks/contexts {"contexts": missing}   (if any)
#      — the additive endpoint. It cannot remove a context, and it does not
#        rebuild the `checks` objects, so each existing check keeps the `app_id`
#        binding it already had. A rebuilt array would silently rebind them.
#   5. GET the contexts again -> after
#   6. assert sort(after) == sort(want), else print all three lists and exit 1
#   7. enforce_admins / required_linear_history / reviews / strict are NOT
#      touched on this path.
# The full PUT survives only for the case where GET …/protection returns 404 —
# a branch with no protection at all, where there is nothing to preserve.
#
# Environment knobs (all optional; the first two exist for the test harness):
#   SETUP_GITHUB_DRY_RUN=1
#       Print every computed request as `DRY RUN: would <METHOD> <path> <body>`
#       and perform NO write of any kind. GET reads still happen unless stubbed.
#   SETUP_GITHUB_STUB_BEFORE='["ctx",…]'
#       JSON array used instead of the first contexts GET.
#   SETUP_GITHUB_STUB_AFTER='["ctx",…]'
#       JSON array used instead of the second contexts GET.
#   SETUP_GITHUB_STUB_PROTECTION_STATUS=200|404|403
#       Used instead of the status of GET …/branches/main/protection. Setting it
#       also stands in for the repo-reachability probe, so a fully stubbed run
#       makes no network call at all (test/setup_github_test.rb asserts that).
#   SETUP_GITHUB_EXTRA_CHECKS='review notes,other'
#       Comma-separated contexts this fork requires that the template does not
#       know about. They are added to the union like any other check. Existing
#       contexts are preserved whether or not they are named here.
#
# The stubs replace READS ONLY. A write is real unless SETUP_GITHUB_DRY_RUN=1.
